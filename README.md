# Data Processing, Training and Inference famework 

This repository provides a framework for processing, training, and making inferences with machine learning models in the context of CMS experiments. It includes scripts for filtering NanoAOD files, merging data, converting to HDF5 format, and running inference with ONNX models.

## Setup Instructions
 

### Step 1. Log into LXPLUS server (CERN computers)

```bash
ssh username@lxplus.cern.ch
```

### Step 2. Set up the required CMSSW version

```bash
cmsrel CMSSW_13_3_0
cd CMSSW_13_3_0/src
cmsenv
```

### Step 3. Clone the repository  and compile 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/castaned/ML-integration-CMSSW DeepNTuples
scram b -j 4
```


## DATA Processing


### Step 1: Set up GRID proxy for accessing files

Ensure you have a valid GRID certificate. If you don’t, follow the instructions [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookStartingGrid#ObtainingCert)

Generate the certificate and store it in the .globus directory:


```bash
voms-proxy-init --voms cms --valid 192:00 --out $HOME/.globus/x509up_u$(id -u)
```

Verify the certificate is correctly generated:
```bash
voms-proxy-info --all
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the directory for job submission

```bash
cd  cd MyNanoAODTools/scripts/
```

### Step 3: Verify dataset and branch selections

- Check that the datasets to process are listed in datasets.yaml in the correct format. For reference, use the DAS query tool [here](https://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/)  (e.g. /WprimeToWZToWlepZlep_narrow_M1000_TuneCP5_13TeV-madgraph-pythia8/RunIISummer20UL18NanoAODv9-106X_upgrade2018_realistic_v16_L1v1-v1/NANOAODSIM)

- Ensure the branchsel.txt file lists the correct branches for the NanoAOD version you're using. You can find branch information
[here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-nanoAOD/nanoaod-doc/-/wikis/home)


### Step 4: Update necessary configuration files

- Modify submit_condor.py to specify where the output files will be saved (e.g., /eos/user/u/username instead of /eos/user/c/castaned).

- Update run_filter.sh: 

  - Change paths to reflect your local environment (e.g., replace /afs/cern.ch/work/c/castaned/CMSSW_13_3_0/src with your path).
    Adjust the EOS directory for filtered files.


### Step 5: Submit the Condor jobs

```bash
condor_submit condor_submit.jdl
```

### Step 6: Monitor job progress

```bash
condor_q
```

### Step 7: Verify the output
Once the jobs complete, check the EOS directory to confirm the skimmed samples were created successfully.

### Merge directories (randomly) and produce h5 files

1. Samples to merge are located in datasets directory, use mergeSamples script to merge into single root files

```bash
mergeSamples.py [events per output file] [output dir] [path to the filelist produced in step 1]
```
e.g.,
```bash
cd DeepNTuples
export OUTDIR=$PWD/datasets 
export MERGEDIR=$PWD/output
mergeSamples.py 200000 ${MERGEDIR} ${OUTDIR}/signal.txt ${OUTDIR}/bkg.txt
```

2. Split into training and testing samples (e.g. separate from 10 files, 7 for training and the rest for test)

```bash
export TRAINDIR=${MERGEDIR}/train
export TESTDIR=${MERGEDIR}/test
mkdir -p $TRAINDIR $TESTDIR
mv ${MERGEDIR}/ntuple_merged_[.0-7.].root ${TRAINDIR}/
mv ${MERGEDIR}/ntuple_merged_*.root ${TESTDIR}/
```


Then you can run


```bash
convert-uproot-opendata.py [input file (.root)] [output file (.h5)]
```
e.g.,
```
convert-uproot-opendata.py ${TRAINDIR}/ntuple_merged_5.root ${TRAINDIR}/ntuple_merged_5.h5
```
which produces `HDF5` files with different arrays for each output variable.



## Training





## Inference

 Ensure to have the requied packages

- onnxruntime: For running the ONNX model.
- uproot: To read NanoAOD files in pure Python.
- numpy: For handling input arrays.

```bash
pip install onnxruntime uproot numpy
```

 Execute script 

```bash
python test_onnx_nanoaod.py
```

The functionalities are: 
- Opens a NanoAOD ROOT file using uproot.
- Extracts electron kinematic variables (pt, eta, phi, mass).
- Loops over each event and selects the first electron.
- Formats the data as an input array for the ONNX model.
- Runs the ONNX model on each event and prints the output.
