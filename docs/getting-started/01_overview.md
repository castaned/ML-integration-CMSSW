# Overview and objectives

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for processing, training, and deploying machine learning models within the context of CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiments at CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire, or European Council for Nuclear Research in english). The framework facilitates data preparation, model training, and evaluation to support ML-based analyses in high-energy physics.

In this framework, the primary goal is to maximize accessibility for physisits who are not used to machine learning development, as well as for new users navigating the complaex CERN computing ecosystem, particularly LXPLUS (Linux Public Login User Service) and CMSSW (CMS SoftWare).

CERN documentation can be difficult to navigate without knowing where to begin. There are multiple websites with different pieces of information, some of which are duplicated, with certain versions beings newer than others. Therefore, this documentation aims to explain the basic concepts and provide references to the pages where we found useful information for implementing and usuing the entire workflow.
